Test the sync again, I think the Secondary Identifier field is not being removed for the learner&supervisor user

Can we remove the OIDC field? Is it required for the sso authentication?
Regardless of CRM field changes, test the dev removeopenid.php by adding a new user and running it

Check what the totaraassessorgroup returns for empty ( --- ) values in CRM.
If it is empty, make it set the user to not assigned (create a record - future enhancements)
If it has a value, change it to not assigned.
